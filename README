this is a proof of concept ftp server that proxies ftp clients requests to putio http.

its alpha, and works for me, using it with FileZilla.

uses pyftpdlib, code is modified from https://github.com/tomatohater/faetus/blob/master/bin/faetus-server . 

why:
 because its really easy to download recursive folders and files using ftp.

installation:

 for *nix users: 
   i. install python 2.6.6 (haven't tested in other versions)
  ii. just download everything in a folder, and run 
     python putio-ftp-connector.py

 iii. from your favorite ftp client login to localhost port 2121 with your putio apikey as your username and apisecret as your password.
	 
 for windows users:

   i. install python 2.6.6 ( http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.6/ ) - i don't know if other versions will work or not. 
  ii. download everything to one folder. double click putio-ftp-connector.py . (when you run connector it will say something like Serving FTP on 192.168.1.225:2121, 192.168.1.255 is your local ip address)
 iii. download filezilla from http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client and enter your local ip address to server and enter 2121 to port. use your putio apikey as username and apisecret as password.
  iv. hit connect, if everything goes well you will see your files.


whats new:
  - works on windows
  - added resume support
  - no more config edits, api key and secret works as username, password
  - removed some unnecessary dependencies, some garbage output.
  - added rename, create dir, move, delete operations.

todos:  
  - not tested with other clients - only filezilla and ncftp -, some ftp commands dont work on others.
  - no file uploads - putio api doesn't have an upload method yet.
  - tons of debug output.
